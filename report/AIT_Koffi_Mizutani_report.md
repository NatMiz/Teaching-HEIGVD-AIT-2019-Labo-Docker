The laboratory instructions can be found [here](../README.md).
The upstream repo of this repo can be found here: <git@github.com:SoftEng-HEIGVD/Teaching-HEIGVD-AIT-2019-Labo-Docker.git>.

In this laboratory we will learn to build our own Docker images and become familiar with process supervision for Docker. We will also see the core concpts for dynammic scaling of an application in production.
Finally we will put into practice decentralized management of web server instance.
